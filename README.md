# SKSSL
This is a shared library turned game engine. "SKSSL" stands for "SolKom Shared Standard Library" This was written in and for C#, and for use with the MonoGame and Gum UI frameworks. Many parts of this library— including its name —are derived from various other fragmented projects of mine whose parts were merged into this. (Example: DustLogger ➡ DustToDust, SolKom ➡ SolarKommand, YAMLParser ➡ XMP, etc.)

## System Information
- .NET 9.0 SDK
- Developer OS: Windows
- Intended OS('s): Windows & Linux (and MacOS? Untested.)
- Framework: Monogame DesktopGL 3.4.2+
- Language(s): C#, YAML, YML

## Program Goal
The goal is to establish a library built on top of Monogame and Gum that acts as a general framework for my other projects. As I progress my skills as a game developer, I am sharing my active understanding of code as the library progresses.

## Limitations
Given that this is a library, it has limitations from C# version 9+ and its other depedencies. The classes are meant to be as ubiquitous as can be, but very-distant dependency versions past the ones this was developed with may cause issues. Otherwise, the limitations are systematic to the library and anything self-referential within it. (E.g. ECS & BaseWorld, SceneManager & BaseWorld, etc.)

## Maintainer's Remarks
This is all a massive work-in-progress, but don't wait for releases! When I find a system in this library satisfactory enough for my other projects I will stop adding to that system. Pull Requests to contribute to the system in places that are no longer actively maintained are welcomed.
